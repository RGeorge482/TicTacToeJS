This is a simple game where I practiced JavaScript. The user can play the game Tic Tac Toe, he needs to choose first the 
box where he wants to place the mark. The sign with which will begin the game will alternate between X and O and when 
all the boxes are marked, the player will receive a message if there is a winner or is a draw. 
The game was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
